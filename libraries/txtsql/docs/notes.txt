txtSQL Notes
===================================================================================================
- The examples included in the 'examples' folder are in no way complete. There are numerous security
  holes (such as SQL-injection) which have not been fixed purpously because these scripts are merely
  examples of what txtSQL is capable of.

- txtSQLAdmin is no longer under 'examples', in-fact it is no longer part of the txtSQL package.
  You may download txtSQLAdmin as a seperate download through the txtSQL website, however.

- Many functions have been renamed for compliance in consistancy of naming conventions

	OLD			   NEW
	============================================
	lockdb                  -> lockDb
	unlockdb                -> unLockDb
	selectDb                -> selectDb
	errordump               -> errorDump
	grant_permissions       -> grantPermissions
	table_exists            -> tableExists
	db_exists               -> dbExists
	table_count             -> tableCount
	last_insert_id          -> lastInsertId
	query_count             -> queryCount
	last_error              -> lastError
	get_last_error          -> getLastError

  For backwards compatibility, the old functions do exist.
